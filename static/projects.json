With a fair amount of experience using React (2+ projects), I chose to extend my knowledge and learn a new framework, and landed on Svelte. Mostly because it was voted the most loved on Stack Overflow's <a href='https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks'>2021 developer survey</a>. SvelteKit was a natural choice for a stream-lined development experience, and tailwind is my favorite way to keep css in class declarations. The nifty timeline graphic is built with SVG, and is meant to look like a git history.",
